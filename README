DBIx::Skinny::ProfilableTransaction
========================

NAME
    DBIx::Skinny::ProfilableTransaction - logging transaction SQL

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

SYNOPSIS
        package Your::DB::Schema;

        use DBIx::Skinny connect_info => +{
            dsn => 'dbi:SQLite:',
            username => '',
            password => '',
        };
        use DBIx::Skinny::ProfilableTransaction;
        1;

        # SKINNY_PROFILE=1 or SKINNY_TRACE=1 ...

DESCRIPTION
    Since version 0.0730, DBIx::Skinny profiler cannot record SQL statements
    about transaction - 'BEGIN WORK', 'COMMIT WORK' and 'ROLLBACK WORK'
    because DBIx::Skinny has used DBIx::TransactionManager instead of
    Skinny::Transaction.

    This module makes profiler modules record those SQL statement.

        use DBIx::Skinny connect_info => ... ;
        use DBIx::Skinny::ProfilableTransaction;
